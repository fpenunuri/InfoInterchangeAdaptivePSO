# InfoInterchangeAdaptivePSO

## 01AdaptPSO
Contains the proposed PSO method.

## 02Synthesis4R
Contains the synthesis of a 4R mechanism for gait rehabilitation.

## 03Michalewicz
Contains the optimization of the Michalewicz function.

## 04RosenbrockRot
Contains the optimization of the rotated Rosenbrock function. The other functions (Sinusoidal problem, Griewank, Rosenbrock) are essentially optimized following the optimization of the Michalewicz function.

## 05PSO_S
Contains the optimization of the Rosenbrock function and the synthesis of a 4R mechanism for gait rehabilitation using the standard PSO algorithm.
